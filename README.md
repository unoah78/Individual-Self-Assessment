## Individual-Self-Assessment

# Self Assessment

This Bootcamp has given me somewhat of a foundation to continously build from. As with anything in life, there are things I could have done better but overall gave it my best with the time that was given to me. Unfortunately there were responsibilities that came up in the middle of my bootcamp expierience that caused me to become severely behind and caused me to rush through the second half of the Modules. Fortunately I can continue to run thorugh these Modules to continue to understand the applications.


I entered this Bootcamp expierence with wanting to add additional tools to my toolbox, which I believe this program has provided.

# Team Assessment

Kudos to Francis, Ashley and Chloe for their collaboration and efforts in this project.

The four of us really worked well together and picked up the pieces where other members of this group neglected. Things started off a little shaky as our garbage pick-up concept was all over the place in terms of what qyestion we were wanting to answer. The weekly communication outside of our Tuesday and Thursday classes help in providing some clarification as we started exploring the data that we had.

# Summary of Project

The idea for this project came from Ashley wondering why one side of her street had trash pickups on certain days vs the otherside of the street having completey opposite days of trash pickups. The bought in was immediate and the four of us agree that Ashley questions could possibly be identified in other cities across the country.

When researching various trash data, we came across a project that the City of Philadelphia conducted in 2014 called "Big Belly Trash". This study placed trash bins with sensor all around the city in order to analyse the level of each of the trash bins.

Reading through the study we discovered that Big Belly is transferring the current contract to the City of Philadelphia and we want to provide data to the city on how they could possibly be more efficent with trash pickups in the city. Therefore some of the question that came to us where:

1. Does Big Belly currently have a schedule for container pickup?
2. How many containers are in the city?
3. What time of day are the containers full?
4. How can we reduce overflowing containers in which cause an uptake in rodents and an eye soar in the community?

There it was, our problem was identified and validtaed by 80 percent of Philadelphians said the streets need to be cleaner.

*Database and Proccessing*

Our group used SQL pgAdmin to clean the data we were able to access by using two CSV and creating tables for each file in pgAdmin. We then merged the files by creating a new table. There were 99,632 observations when merging the two files.

*Analysis*

We chose to use MATPLOTLIB library in Python.

For our Machine Learning model we decided that Random Forest - Classification Problem would best suit our needs in predicting the pickups for the last 11 days of the month of January based off of the groups we created in our analysis. Big Belly is transferring the contract over to the City of Philadelphia and to save time and resources we have gathered the containers should be only picked up when they are overflowing or near full. 

In summary, this project while challenging provided a positive ending to my Bootcamp expierence mostly due to the team I was assigned too!
